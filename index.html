    <h1>CSE 168 Spring 2017 Final Project</h1>
    <div>
    <p>Implemented multi-frame animation with motion blur. That's all.</p>
    <p>Initially was going to implement caustics, enhanced by photon mapping, hence the blinds and all (inspired by a reference image
        in which light filtered through blinds and caused some neat caustics via my plastic water bottle with water in it).</p>
    <p>However, could not get my spatial data structure for an efficient photon map working (rendering took literally ages), so switched
        to motion blur at the last minute. Hence the relatively miserable state of the final render.</p>
    <p>This was implemented quite simply by distributing rays across a Time dimension ranging [0,1], and then lerping individual components
       of the two transformation matrices. In the rendered image above, I imagined a dragon (homage to Dragon model) darting around in
       an enclosed space (here, a slightly modified Cornell box).</p>
